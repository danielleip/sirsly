Where I'm Going,none,You Haunt Me,3:20,2014,9,16,"Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. I was born in a cloud, floating around. With nothing to hold to. Soaked in the sound, deep underground. Just like I told you. Climbing the rungs, back to the top. Look out the skyline. Finding the one all of a sudden.That's what I want. That's what I need. That's where I'm going. That's who I wanna be. All of my love was wasted on you. That's how it happens. That's what I wanna do. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Ah ah ah. Back in the days. Boys used to play. And women were fearless. Now we're afraid stuck in the daze. Please don't come near us. Never want a thing just to fall apart. Then I went ahead and I opened my heart. My heart, my heart. That's what I want. That's what I need. That's where I'm going. That's who I wanna be. All of my love was wasted on you. That's how it happens. That's what I wanna do. I got you right where I want you.

Ghost,none,You Haunt Me,3:37,2014,9,16,"Go ahead and stand up straight, Straight against the wall. Why did I go before you, Pick you up when you fall? Was I too drunk to say what I said to you? Was I too blind to go and see straight through you? Ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You flew out on a plane, And crashed into the ocean. And then you haunted me, Don't have a clue what's in motion. So every now and then it feels so soothing, When you float on a bit and move right through me. Ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. Yeah. One, two, three, four. Get up save face. Find your way back to the grave. Undead go find your way back home. Get up save face. Find your way back to the grave.

And I hope you find, I hope you find your dream. And darling never settle, settle, settle, Chasing down the devil, devil, Chasing down the gods, And I hope you find, I hope you find your dream.

Found You Out,none,You Haunt Me,3:37,2014,9,16,"I'm running, Tired of this complex. I was jealous, knowing that you wanted more. Are you sure? How was it? Did you get it faster? I hope it's everything you want and more. There's the door. A taker and a giver, Oh you made me shiver. Couldn't I deliver? Oh I guess I found you out. My table didn't need a Judas. Your pride it turned you into Brutus now, Now. I paid until you couldn't cover. I lost a confidante and lover now, Oh now. A taker and a giver, Oh you make me shiver. Could not deliver, Oh I guess I found you. A taker and a giver, Oh you make me shiver. Could not deliver, Oh I guess I found you out. Oh I guess I found you out.

"Nowhere / Bloodlines, Pt. I",none,You Haunt Me,4:32,2014,9,16,"You woke me up in the middle of the night, Lit a candle and we bathed in the light. You said you're scared of the city we're in. Want to make it better, but I can't begin to, Make it alright. Write another story, we're fine. We'll make it alright. We'll write another story, we're fine. You said you know that you're going nowhere, Know that you're going nowhere, Know that you're going nowhere. I'll follow you there. I'll follow you there. Losing patience with the circles we draw, Talking slow and now I'm seeing all my flaws. I'm having trouble being honest again, Put the bottle down and slowly begin to, Make it alright. Write another story, we're fine. We'll make it alright. We'll write another story, we're fine. I know that I'm going nowhere, Know that I'm going nowhere, Know that I'm going nowhere. Follow me there. I know that I'm going nowhere, Know that I'm going nowhere, Know that I'm going nowhere. You follow me there. I'll try to figure out how to say this, I'm losing my mind in these mazes. I'm losing my mind in these pages. There's blood on my hands I can taste it. Give us back the time that we wasted. If I'd have know how it ends, I'd have changed it, All those fucking nights that we wasted, And all those fucking nights that we wasted. I believed in you and then you fell apart. You broke my trust, you broke my heart, Again, Again. One more drop your stomach dies. Disintegrate before my eyes, Again, Again, Again. Waiting on your bloodlines, Waiting on your bloodlines, Again. How could you make me wait? Draw a picture with your bloodlines, Picture with the bloodlines, A thousand words and then escape.",1610253,6,no
Inferno,Lizzy Plapinger,You Haunt Me,2:49,2014,9,16,"I think you clipped my wings to save me from the sun. Forgot my hands and knees, I had to learn a lesson. Oh fearless teacher how'd I ever lose my sight. Why'd I ever try to fight against your path? Somewhere at half my life I wandered in the woods. Can't find a single right, I swear nothing is good. I’m blinded now and darkness shrouds my every sight. Why'd I ever try to fight for my own path? I don't know why. I must be out of my mind. No I'm going, going, going, gone. Going, going, going, gone. I don't know why. I must be out of my mind. I'm just going, going, going, gone. Going, going, going on my own. A leopard, lion, wolf and mountain in my way. I'm coming up for light and I'm coming out of the cave. Only a prodigal could understand my life. Why'd I ever try to fight against your path? I go through hell and back and try to find my place. The poet shows me how I had to fall from grace. The devil stares me down he's trapped himself in ice. Why'd I ever try to fight for my own path? I don't know why. I must be out of my mind. No I'm going, going, going, gone. Going, going, going, gone. I don't know why. I must be out of my mind. I'm just going, going, going, gone. Going, going, going on my own.

Leave You,none,You Haunt Me,3:13,2014,9,16,"When you’re standing at the start of what you wanted. Do you ever really think of how it ends? How a broken heart will mend. Or how many people you will lose as friends? When you're fading in and out of being conscious. Do you ever try to make amends? Think of how the plagues will end. Or how you would come back from the bends? I know that dreams come true. But I never thought that I would have to leave you. You, you. (That I would have to leave you). You, you. (That I would have to leave you). I can’t convince myself to keep on faking nonsense. So I’m letting go and pushing you away. There’s no reason left to stay. I can’t afford to wait another forty days. Wasting all that time was weighing on my conscious. I feel undone again, a feeling that I cannot shake. Think I'm finally awake. I'd rather do it right than make it being fake. I know that dreams come true. But I never thought that I would have to leave you. You, you. (That I would have to leave you). You, you.

A familiar, anxious spiral. I could write these words a thousand times and recite them like my Holy Bible. Maybe falling in love is vital. And if I don't try now, I won't be able to when I'd like to.
