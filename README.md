# Sir Sly Analysis Project 

## Danielle Ip 

Hello! This is an ongoing project where I visualize and investigate different analyses for my all-time favorite band. 

This is not meant to woo people, it's more of a sandbox for me to learn and experiment with NLP and sentiment analysis tools in python and R, and appreciate the music more.
